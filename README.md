# NWB Zarr Format

![header-image](Resources/header-image.png)

A Record Engine plugin for the Open Ephys GUI based on the [Neurodata Without Borders 2.X specification](https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_release_notes.html). It stores data in Zarr files instead of HDF5.

**Disclaimer:** This plugin is still under development, and should not be used for experiments.

## Building from source

First, follow the instructions on [this page](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/Developer-Guide/Compiling-the-GUI.html) to build the Open Ephys GUI.

This plugin depends on the [OpenEphysZarrLib](https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/OpenEphysZarrLib) common library. Make sure you build and install that first before you proceed with building this plugin.

Then, clone this repository into a directory at the same level as the `plugin-GUI`, e.g.:
 
```
Code
├── plugin-GUI
│   ├── Build
│   ├── Source
│   └── ...
├── OEPlugins
│   └── nwb-zarr-format
│       ├── Build
│       ├── Source
│       └── ...
```

### Windows

**Requirements:** [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 ..
```

Next, launch Visual Studio and open the `OE_PLUGIN_nwb-zarr-format.sln` file that was just created. Select the appropriate configuration (Debug/Release) and build the solution.

Selecting the `INSTALL` project and manually building it will copy the `.dll` and any other required files into the GUI's `plugins` directory. The next time you launch the GUI from Visual Studio, `NWB-ZARR` should appear as an data format option in the Record Node.


### Linux

**Requirements:** [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
cd Debug
make -j
make install
```

This will build the plugin and copy the `.so` file into the GUI's `plugins` directory. The next time you launch the compiled version of the GUI, `NWB-ZARR` should appear as an data format option in the Record Node.


### macOS

**Requirements:** [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/)

From the `Build` directory, enter:

```bash
cmake -G "Xcode" ..
```

Next, launch Xcode and open the `nwb-format.xcodeproj` file that now lives in the “Build” directory.

Running the `ALL_BUILD` scheme will compile the plugin; running the `INSTALL` scheme will install the `.bundle` file to `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/open-ephys/plugins-api8`. `NWB-ZARR` should now appear as an data format option in the Record Node.
